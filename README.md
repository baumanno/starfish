Starfish - A Software-Engineering project @ LMU
===============================================
 
This application was developed over the course of one year at LMU Munich.
It was meant as an introduction to software-engineering and the developers highly recommend not using this in productive environments.
The code does what it is supposed to do; however, side-effects cannot be ruled out entirely.

Please use this at your own risk and consider it an example which can (and should) be improved in many places.

Keep calm and happy hacking!
